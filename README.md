Hora Challenge
I have used Firebase database in the project. The url of the database is https://hora-d523e.firebaseio.com/

Tasks Completed: In Worker mode: List of all incoming pending tasks completed.
                                  Filter tasks by category completed. (I have take category 1 and category 2 as demo).
                                  worker can sort the tasks according to the distance.
                                  Worker can see the details of the task. And accept it.
                                  Worker can mark the task completed and rate the consumer.
                                  List of his pending tasks.
                                  List of his completed tasks.
                                  
                                  In Consumer mode: 
                                  List of the all the tasks created by him.
                                  He can create the tasks.
                                  Time and location will be taken automatically.
                                  
 Tasks left: Notification on new task created.
              Updating the database when worker marks the task completed.
